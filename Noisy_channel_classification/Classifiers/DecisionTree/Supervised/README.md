Todo:
In order to implement a decision tree, you can select between autoencoder feature extraction or PCA.
Besides, a grid search has been applied to find the best hyperparameters for the structure of the decision tree.
Various diagrams has been plotted to show the performance of model such as confusion matrix
In order to run the model using Gaussian noise, just use latent_space_classifier
